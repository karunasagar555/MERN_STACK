Q) what is React ?

S : A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.


npx create-react-app project_Name -> npx create-react-app reactapp (Project Name should not contain Capital Letters) -> this command Installs packages like react,react-DOM and react-scripts with cra-template.

npm start -> Starts the development server.

npm run build -> Bundles the app into static files for production.

npm test -> Starts the test runner.

npm run eject -> Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!, We suggest that you begin by typing, cd reactapp then npm start.

without React : HTML/CSS/JS -> DOM -> render on Browser

NOTE : React uses an algorithm called #Diffing, now what's the use of this algo ? It Identifies changes made in code.

React : code-> Diffing Algo -> Virtual DOM -> DOM -> render on Browser

Q) what does this virtual DOM do ?
s: it identifies the required changes.

Q) what are the advantages of React ?
S:  1) very fast
    2) Easy Event handling (shortcuts)
    3) small libraray compared to angular which is vast -> easy to learn
    4) It manages UI by State - let us assume state as a variable, on State change UI is changed accordingly.


NOTE : In React, DOM is created only for the changes that were made and combines with the former DOM, In HTML/CSS/JS, the whole page is reloaded (In react, only that part is reloaded where the changes were made) once any changes are made and a whole new DOM is created everytime.
