NOTE : Javascript is a synchronous and single-threaded language (meaning it can only do one thing at a time and in a specific order)





///// Function Statements & Function Expressions

Q) what is a Function Statement ?

S:  function a() {
       console.log("a called");
}

NOTES : Functions are HEART of JS, they are the FIRST CLASS CITIZENS.

Q) what is a Function Expression ?

S: we can assign a function to a variable, function acts like a value here, we are putting function into b.

var b = function () {
    console.log("b called");
}

NOTE : both Function Statements and Function Expressions are ways to create functions, the difference between these is in HOISTING.



















////// Event Bubbling and Event Capturing

1) what is Event Bubbling ?

s: Bubbling 


2) what is Event Capturig ?

s: it is an event which trickles down the DOM hierarchy, it has a performance issue and is very expensive

Note : Eventbubling is used by default if we do not pass any third argument insdie the eventlistener function

Note : Event Capturing is also known as Event Trickling

Note : According to W3C model the whole chain is anyways followed, the trickling down happens then the bubbling up happens whether you do anything 

Note : According to W3C, first the event propogation happens TOP-DOWN the hierarchy ie Capturing happens first than bubbling out happens and the callback methods are called according to the parameters what we pass (true and false) 

Q) what are callback Functions in JS ?
S: the function which is passed into another function is known as a callback function.

Q) what is the significance of this callBack function ?
S: this function is very powerful in JS, it gives us access to the whole Asynchronous world in a synchronous single-threaded language, because of callBack functions we can do ASYNCHRONOUS things inside JS.

Q) what is MAIN THREAD ??
s : // callStack aka MAIN THREAD, callstack is also called as MAIN THREAD.


Q) what is blocking the MAIN THREAD ?
s: if any operation blocks this callstack that is called blocking the MAIN THREAD.

Q) what is setTimeout ?
S: It is a web API/Browser API
